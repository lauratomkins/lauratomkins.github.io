## About

I am a second year Ph.D. student in Geospatial Analytics at NC State University advised by Dr. Sandra Yuter.

I completed my Bachelor's degree in Meteorology at NC State in 2017. While I was I then went on to complete a Master's degree in Atmospheric Science in 2019 at The University of Kansas where I was advised by Dr. David Mechem. For my M.S. thesis I used the WRF model to simulate stratocumulus cloud-eroding boundaries over the southeast Atlantic Ocean. After finishing my master's, I came back to NC State to persue my Ph.D. in Geospatial Analytics. For my current research, I use remotely sensed data from satellite, ground-based radar, and aircraft radar to observe the dynamic features within winter storms.
